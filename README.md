# Graduate Admission Prediction

This repository contains a Graduate Admission Prediction model built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model predicts the chances of a student's admission based on various input parameters. The project also includes a user-friendly web application deployed using Streamlit.

## Overview

Graduate Admission Prediction is a crucial aspect for students applying to universities for higher education. This project aims to assist students in estimating their chances of getting admitted to a university based on their academic and extracurricular profile.

## Features

- **Input Parameters**: The model takes the following input columns:
  - GRE Score
  - TOEFL Score
  - University Rating
  - SOP (Statement of Purpose)
  - LOR (Letter of Recommendation)
  - CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)
  - Research (Research Experience)

- **Model**: The prediction model is built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to ensure high accuracy and performance.

- **Web Application**: A user-friendly web interface is created using Streamlit to allow users to input their data and get immediate predictions.


## Repository Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `model.py`: The file containing the ANN model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training.
- `requirements.txt`: The list of required Python packages.
